Both team members worked side-by-side as we discussed ideas about
the heuristic and how to implement the algorithm.

Working side by side, Andrew created the heuristic that
weights the tiles and implemented an iterative verseion
of the minimax function while Steven improved upon it
and implemented the function recursively.

We decided to use a recursive minimax function that employs
a heuristic that weights the tiles. Sadly, we don't think
our AI is tournament worthy. We can guarantee our AI will put
forth maximum effort nevertheless.
